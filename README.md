Title: Campus Bridge
Domain : Web Development
Problem Statement: “Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform"
Description :
The Faculty-Student Portal is a web-based application built to enhance communication, academic collaboration, and resource sharing between students and faculty members within an educational institution. 
It is designed with a robust role-based login system that securely authenticates users and grants access to features tailored to their specific roles. Upon login, users are directed to their respective 
dashboards — one for faculty and one for students — each offering a customized set of tools and functionalities.

Faculty members have the ability to upload course materials, create and manage assignments, track student submissions, and post important announcements. This allows instructors to centralize their course 
content and streamline interaction with students. The portal also helps reduce manual workload by organizing student data, assignments, and updates in a structured and easily accessible format.

Students, on the other hand, gain access to their own dashboard where they can view and download study materials, submit assignments, check feedback and grades, and stay updated on class announcements. 
This empowers students with a clear, organized view of their academic responsibilities and ensures they are always in sync with the latest updates from their instructors.

The portal provides a clean and intuitive interface that prioritizes user experience and ease of navigation. It also incorporates secure login mechanisms to ensure data privacy and protect user information. 
Whether used in schools, colleges, or universities, this application serves as a digital bridge between faculty and students, making academic life more efficient, connected, and accessible.

This platform can be extended with additional features such as a discussion forum, real-time notifications, and admin-level control for enhanced management. It is a scalable solution adaptable to the unique 
needs of any educational institution.
